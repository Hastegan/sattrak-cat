# sattrak-catalog
SatTrak Catalog is a RESTful API designed to gather or compute data about
satellites orbiting earth.

## Why ?
There are already services that allows you to get this kind of data, but none is
providing a clean way to present it. I also wanted a service able to make a
few basic calculations on positions. I ended up starting my own project.
